## Plant disease detection 
### We are trying to predict diseased plant and plant leaves from a dataset of healthy and disease plants and its leaves.
#### Here we have built a cnn model from scratch taking a dataset of 288 diseased cotton leaves, 815 diseased cotton plants,427 fresh cotton leaves, 421 fresh cotton plants
#### We have kept the batch size to 16 and epochs of 50 and getting an accuracy around 90, but we can increase epochs to 500 to get the best accuracy.
#### We have added checkpoints to tell us the best accuracy in each epoch.
#### I havent provided the dataset over here but you can train your own dataset or get it easily from the web.
